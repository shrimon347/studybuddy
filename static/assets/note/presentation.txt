Thank you rakib, Assalamualikum 
For our project design we chose Evolutionary Model This model has a number of advantages such as Users involvement, 
taking feedback from the users during development, and building the exact product that the user wants.
Technology used in our project for fron-end we use html css javascript and bootstrap
and for backend we used python based framwork django and django RestFramework
and for database we used MYSQL
Two module used in our project admin and User
In admin module admin can manage Notes, manage the users and monotoring the overall activities
and In user module user can uplod notes, search notes by subject, download notes, delete notes
and also create the blog and room for building community  
some implementation of our project
During the project design with the help of our honorable supervisor
We have already solved many problems. Future task will be -
User authentication with google, github and facebook.
Room create and also search option will be implemented.
Blog writing will be implemented.
Note uploading, downloading and deleting will be implemented.
Database design and Implementation. 


Models Comparision:
The waterfall model is more rigid and suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, whereas the evolutionary model is more flexible and adaptive, making it better suited for projects with changing or unclear requirements, where client involvement and feedback are crucial
